# aggregate
  # two-step approach, because grade and yield first are weighted based on value
    # and if weight is NA, then grade is set to NA as well (for which ifelse function doesn't work)
  # therefore first everything where value (i.e. the weight) is not NA, is aggregated with weighted.mean()
  # and then everything where value is NA, is aggregated just with mean()
  # also, for upper aggregation, grade and yield go first, because they're based on value which is also aggregated afterwards
  # furthermore, no point in also including amount_sold as weight if value is NA, because too few cases: sheet_com %>% filter(is.na(value) & !is.na(grade) & !is.na(amount_sold))
