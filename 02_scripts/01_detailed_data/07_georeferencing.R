# assign points, multipoints or shapefiles to each mine in sheet_general
# mines which have no sub_sites, and have exact coordinates, will have the type point (exact) assigned
# mines which have sub_sites with coordinates will have the type multipoint (exact) assigned
# mines which have no coordinates and no sub_sites will have a shapefile of the finest possible granularity assigned
# regions will have a shapefile of the finest possible granularity assigned
# such a shapefile can be, for example, the shapefile of a district, a shapefile of several districts combined, or the shapefile of a state

# bind the sheets general and subsites together --------------------------------

#then, bind the sheet general and sheet_sub_sites "beneath" each other
general <- bind_rows(general, sub_sites)

# the only column that has a different naming in the two sheets but refers to the same is:
# mining_facility_types (in sheet_general) and mine_types (in sheet_sub_sites).
# therefore, they are put together into one column, named mining_facility_types
general$mining_facility_types <- coalesce(general$mining_facility_types, general$mine_types)
general <- select(general, -mine_types)

# now as described above, the column mine_fac and sub_site together act as the primary key.
# to simplify, a new column mine_id is created, which simply is the two strings bound together. 
# this leads to the (aggregated) mine always having its original mine_fac string as mine_id, while sub_sites have 
# their mine_id as a composite of mine_fac and sub_site. The columns mine_fac and sub_site will be kept in order to easily
# identify which parent mine_fac a sub_site belongs to.
